# R_Shiny_App_Project

This project presents an **interactive Shiny app** visualizing data on renewable energy. The app consists of four pages, each containing two visualisations and a final page with a copyright notice. 

The following visualisations were created: a world map, area graph, bar graph, line graph, scatter plot, stacked bar chart, data table and faceted graph. 

On each page there is an interactive filtering option - the visualisation changes depending on which year, countries or region were chosen. 

The project was written in R and graphs were created using ggplot. 

The app can be viewed on [shinyapps.io](https://kingasiwiec.shinyapps.io/R_Shiny_App/).

This project was created as part of Coursera specialization [Data Visualization & Dashboarding with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-visualization-dashboarding-with-r).

I used a dataset published under Creative Commons BY license by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org) and created by Hannah Ritchie, Max Roser and Edouard Mathieu. The dataset is available [here](https://github.com/owid/energy-data). An inspiration for the creation of the graphs was [this](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy) page.
